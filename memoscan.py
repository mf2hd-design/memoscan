For **each key** provide:

Key|Score/10|Short Title|Strategic Explanation

‚Äî‚Äî THE SIX KEYS & WHAT TO MEASURE ‚Äî‚Äî  
1. **Emotion** ‚Äì Does the content evoke positive feelings (warmth, trust, excitement, admiration)? Assess imagery, tone of voice, word choice, and storytelling techniques that stimulate emotion.  
2. **Attention** ‚Äì Does the site instantly capture attention and sustain interest? Judge distinctiveness, surprising elements, pacing, and creative hooks.  
3. **Story** ‚Äì Is there a clear, coherent narrative that conveys purpose and values? Measure clarity of message hierarchy, brand origin, and future vision.  
4. **Involvement** ‚Äì How well does the brand invite interaction or make the audience feel part of a community? Look for calls-to-action, interactive features, or inclusive language.  
5. **Repetition** ‚Äì Are key visual, verbal, or thematic elements reused to reinforce recall? Evaluate repeated slogans, colour cues, typography, or sound cues across the page.  
6. **Consistency** ‚Äì Are design, tone, and messaging aligned across sections, creating a familiar and trustworthy experience? Check layout grids, typography hierarchy, imagery style, and tonal coherence.
